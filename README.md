Around the World Travel App is a full stack JavaScript application with an Express server and MongoDB database created as our CodeClan module 2 group project.

## Our Brief :clipboard:	

### Travel App

We want to create a bucket-list app using a countries api. The app will provide information on countries and allow users to interact through different routes and choose the country they would like to add to their bucket-list. They can also mark countries as visited.

### MVP

A user should be able to: -

Use a country API to bring in content
view a country and details about that country
be able to interact with the page to move through different sections of content
have a drop down list of country that the user uses to pick a country
allow users to add countries to the visited/want-to-visit list. The list will be stored using mongodb.

### Example Extensions

countries are also searchable (search-bar with timeout?)
user can add comments about visits they have made.
implement the use of maps to display the country in a more interactive and interesting way.
the map will provide navigation around the app instead of a drop-down/list.
Bring in more data with multiple APIs.
users can attain badges for visiting different countries.
add multiple visits to a country in visited list
