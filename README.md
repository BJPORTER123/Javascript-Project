# Around the World Travel App :earth_africa: :earth_americas: :earth_asia:	
Around the World Travel App is a country tracking app allowing the user to create a bucket list of countries they want to visit and track where they have already been. It is a full stack JavaScript application built with React using an Express server and MongoDB database created as our CodeClan module 2 group project.

## Our Brief :clipboard:	

### Travel App

We want to create a bucket-list app using a countries api. The app will provide information on countries and allow users to interact through different routes and choose the country they would like to add to their bucket-list. They can also mark countries as visited.

### MVP

#### A user should be able to: -

* Use a country API to bring in content
* View an individual country and details about that country
* Be able to interact with the page to move through different sections of content
* Have a drop down list of country that the user uses to pick a country
* Allow users to add countries to the visited/want-to-visit list. The list will be stored using mongodb.

### Example Extensions

* Countries are also searchable (search-bar with timeout?)
* User can add comments about visits they have made.
* Users can attain badges for visiting different countries.
add multiple visits to a country in visited list
* Implement the use of maps to display the country in a more interactive and interesting way.
* Use the map will provide navigation around the app instead of a drop-down/list.
* Bring in more data with multiple APIs.

## Built With :building_construction:
* JavaScript
* React
* ReactRouter
* Express.Js
* MongoDB
